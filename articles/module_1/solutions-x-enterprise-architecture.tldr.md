# Differences Between Solutions & Enterprise Architecture
Enterprise Architecture (EA) provides a comprehensive framework for aligning business processes, data, and IT across an organization, ensuring long-term strategic integration. Solutions Architecture (SA), on the other hand, focuses on designing specific IT solutions to meet immediate business needs, aligning them with the overall EA. EA covers the entire enterprise with a long-term perspective, while Solutions Architecture is project-specific with a short to medium-term focus.
