# Solutions Architecture

Solution architecture in IT defines a technical vision aligned with business goals, integrating software, hardware, networks, and services into a cohesive system. Solution architects design these comprehensive solutions to address specific business needs, such as integrating online and offline sales channels for retail or implementing fraud detection systems for financial institutions. The role evolved with the shift from rigid waterfall models to agile methodologies, ensuring compatibility and efficiency in complex enterprise projects. Solution architecture bridges the gap between business strategy and technical implementation, critical for successful IT projects.
